    "# Logical Battleship\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains my solutions for the Artificial Intelligence (NLP) course that I attended during the second semester - academic year 2023/2024 - of M.Sc. in Machine Learning & Big Data at the University of Naples \"Parthenope\" (@uniparthenope). The course covered basic and introductive topics of Artificial Intelligence, and I completed the project, which is described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "## The project\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the project is to create a knowledge agent capable of playing battleship and coding its knowledge base and rules using prepositional logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumption \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity's sake, it was decided to have a fixed arrangement of ships for the player and the agent, as the focus of the project is to develop the agent's reasoning ability and to provide him with an explicit knowledge representation. \n",
    "In particular for the latter aspect, the following were expressed through prepositional logic: the rules of the game, the structure of the ships (number of boxes for each type of ship), the number of ships available and the size of the playing field.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure and instruments\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was chosen as the programming language to realise the project, and in particular the Aima logic library was used to handle the agent logic in the form of prepositional logic. The programme consists of 3 files: the main, a file containing the implementation of the game and another containing the implementation of the agent. These are represented by the files respectively: logicalBattleship.py, battleshipGame.py and battleshipAgent.py ."
